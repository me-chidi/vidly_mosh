pseudo-code preluded by #

# what makes a checkout page?
# get movie_id, daily rate 
# display the movie and dets then checkout price beside it
# big button to purchase > purchase successful! page
#   almost done, register the models in admin and create 
#   counter functionality for movies
#   using mysql connector i believe -later


# genre displays the diff movies under the diff genres in list view
#   done but for better control flow could've made genre an app 
#   so as to enable functionality to circle back to movies
